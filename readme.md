# ABOUT
### This app is made to facilitate the work of agile teams.

## How it works:
The users of this app are divided into 4 categories:
* Coach (There can only be `one` coach.)
* Scrum master
* Product Owner
* Developer

## Coach's role:
The database usually contains a collection of Scrum Masters, Product Owners and Developers.

#### A team is formed by selecting one of each of these three categories.

Aside from selecting a team, the coach is responsible for creating projects and assigning these projects to one or multiple teams.

#### Note that: Each team can only work on one project.

Moreover, the coach can create questionnaires for teams to answer, or category specific questionnaires i.e questionnaires for scrum masters only , etc...

After the users answer the questionnaire, the coach can view the statistics in the form of a chart.

## Other users' role:
The normal users are supposed to monitor their project's time limit, and complete their tasks accordingly.

They are also supposed to answer the questionnaires set up by their coach for feedback, if they are assigned any.

## Features to be possibly added in the future:
* Users sending complaints to their coach.
* Direct messaging between team members.
